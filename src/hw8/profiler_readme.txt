Discuss the differences in sorting times between the different algorithms and the two text files.

Overall, Merge Sort seems to be the best sorting algorithm of the three in terms of runtime for any
given set, running under one second for both files. Selection sort is significantly slower overall, 
taking approximately three seconds for both txt files. Insertion sort is also very slow sorting a 
random set, taking almost a similar time.

However, insertion sort is much more effective at sorting a partially sorted set than it is for a 
random set, as it ran numlist2.txt at a time similar to merge sort.
