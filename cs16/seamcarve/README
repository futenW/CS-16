--Seamcarve README--

Handin: Will resubmit later

Design Choices:
    Seamcarve has 2 classes: an App class and a MyPicturePane class. MyPicturePane implements the bulk of the seamcarve
    algorithm in the findLowestCostSeam() method. It is implemented in three steps: 1) the importance array is calculated,
    2) the cost and dirs arrays are calculated simultaneously, and 3) the least-cost seam is calculated using the cost
    and dirs arrays.

Known Bugs: none
